Sum, product, and range of data
=========================

Sums, differences, and products
-------------------------

### Sum and cumulative sum

```{r}
age <- c(17, 30, 30, 25, 23, 21)
sum(age)
cumsum(age)
```

### Successive differences

```{r}
diff(age)
diff(age, lag=2)
```

### Product and cumulative product

```{r}
prod(age)
cumprod(age)
factorial(5)
```

Minimum, maximum and range
-------------------------

### Get the minimum, maximum and range

```{r}
min(age)
max(age)
range(c(17, 30, 30, 25, 23, 21))
diff(range(c(17, 30, 30, 25, 23, 21)))
```

### Identify the minimum and maximum elements

```{r}
which.min(age)
which.max(age)
```

Identify element closest to a value (here: 0)

```{r}
vec <- c(-5, -8, -2, 10, 9)
val <- 0
which.min(abs(vec-val))
```

### Pairwise minimum and maximum

```{r}
vec1 <- c(5, 2, 0, 7)
vec2 <- c(3, 3, 9, 2)
pmax(vec1, vec2)
pmin(vec1, vec2)
```
