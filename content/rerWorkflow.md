Write R markdown
-------------------------

The articles on this website were generated from R markdown files - plain text documents that seamlessly integrate R commands and their output with text. To get started with writing R markdown, have a look at

 - [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): text formatting with integrated [R](https://www.r-project.org/) commands
 - R package [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/) from Yihui Xie: convert R markdown to markdown
 - Integrated development environment [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.org/): great support for knitr and markdown
